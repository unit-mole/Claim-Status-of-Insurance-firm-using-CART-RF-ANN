# Claim-Status-of-Insurance-firm-using-CART-RF-ANN

The given data set has number columns and rows in them. The given data provides us the information with regards to the insurance firm. A Classification and Regression Tree (CART), is a predictive model, which explains how an outcome variable's values can be predicted based on other values. A CART output is a decision tree where each fork is a split in a predictor variable and each end node contains a prediction for the outcome variable. Random Forest (RF) is one of the many machine learning algorithms used for supervised learning, this means for learning from labelled data and making predictions based on the learned patterns. RF can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Artificial Neural networks (ANN) or neural networks are computational algorithms. It intended to simulate the behavior of biological systems composed of “neurons”. ANNs are computational models inspired by an animal's central nervous systems. It is capable of machine learning as well as pattern recognition.
An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. The management decides to collect data from the past few years. You are assigned the task to make a model which predicts the claim status and provide recommendations to management. Use CART, RF & ANN and compare the models' performances in train and test sets.
